# ideas



mechanics:
- you can choose what you want to use before each run
- you can only take a certain number
  - inventory system with slots
  - or maybe inventory based on size/weight
  - buy more inventory space?
- make it unclear what shop purchases do?
  - i think this is ok as long as there are only a *few* mystery items, not all
  - and call them something funky like "cloak of absternation"
  - or maybe lootboxes? (jk)
  - to make it even more fun, shuffle/generate the names so that they are different each playthrough
- maybe scraps, like you have to buy a few of a certain kind of a thing to even use it
- maybe like unrailed - the shop rotates/is random after each round
- items can have side effects
  - cosmetics maybe increase score/coins
  - making game harder (faster tempo) maybe increases score/coins, etc.
